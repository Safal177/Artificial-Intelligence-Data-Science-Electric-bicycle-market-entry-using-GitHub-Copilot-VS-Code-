# Artificial Intelligence Data Science: Electric bicycle market entry using GitHub Copilot (VS Code)

# Project Background
This project covered a task (Enhancing Product Launches) with Visual Studio Code (V. S. Code) and Microsoft Edge Copilot. In this project, a CEO is going to a releases e-bike within 3 months. AI tools such as Copilot used in VS Code and Microsoft Edge were applied to maximize selection pipelines, unify team efforts, and generate exceptional materials for stakeholder collaboration.  Some actions such as strategic objectives, market analysis, financial predictions etc were created using GitHub Copilot. These were optimized and standardized for business purposes.

# Tools and Technology: 
•	GitHub copilot (V. S. Code): Used to make well-defined business reports.
•	AI powered Microsoft edge copilot: Limitedly used for high-performing analysis with strategic evaluations
•	Markdown (V. S. Code): Applied for effectively formatting content
•	Dashboard structures (excel, and word): Implemented for KPI monitoring, and financial expectations. 
•	Analytics based method: Applied model, KPIs, and defined metrics to take business quality

# Project Objective:
•	Strategic priorities: Include targets (e. g. market share, revenue growth, and customer acquisition) in Copilot used in V. S. code
•	Market analysis: Research on market trends, customer groups, and the market environment for e-bikes. 
•	Team accountability: State advanced roles as well as responsibilities in the fields of product innovation, marketing, and Sales organization.  
•	Marketing strategy: Outline marketing campaigns focusing for city residents with the e-bike's features 
•	Financial and key performance indicators (KPIs) tracking platforms: Develop financial models with recognizing financial and KPIs tracking dashboard. 
•	Crisis management: Adapt strategies for hypothetical disruption, such as supply chain delays or competitor actions, and then make crisis management plans with updating strategic objectives for minimizing risks.

# Project Conclusion:
•	V. S. code and copilots (AI) were successfully used to make strategical plans focusing for business objectives. 
•	Outcomes from this project covered a strategic framework, market analysis document, team accountability approach, marketing plan, financial models with KPI, and crisis management solving issues. 
•	Accelerates business planning operations and then supports decisions making according to data structure reviewed under AI systems. 
•	This project emphasizes business-oriented strategies including data analysis tools used for key roles in data science, data analytics, and python machine learning. .
